1. Determine the number of days for the given month in the year **2020** as an integer without using `date` methods.
1. It will output the numbers of days in the given month for the year 2020 as an integer.
1. If the given value is not one of the twelve months in a year it will output the message `Invalid month`.
1. Test to ensure the program passes the provided tasks found in the [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) file
1. Answer the questions below.
1. Commit your changes and verify the formatting of the README.md file is correct in GitHub.
